                    As a fresher stepping into the world of programming,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    you're not just learning syntax and logic, 
                    you're building the foundation for endless possibilities.

                    At first glance, coding might seem like a series of puzzles to solve, 
                    but over time, it becomes a way of thinking, a way of approaching problems,
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    and an exciting path of continuous learning,
                    And that why i a love learning new things,
                    Curiose about every thing, never afraid to ask and learn.
